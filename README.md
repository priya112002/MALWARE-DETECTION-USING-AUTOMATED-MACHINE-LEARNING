# MALWARE-DETECTION-USING-AUTOMATED-MACHINE-LEARNING
Malware is a harmful and dangerous software that can cause harm to your computer pretending to be a legitimate program. 
Malware is categorized into many types such as: viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware.

Machine learning (ML), has become a popular technique to develop malware detection solutions, and has shown promising results because of its ability to learn generalized patterns to identify unseen malware.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It enables ML models to be built with high scalability, efficiency, and productivity while maintaining model quality by data scientists, analysts, and developers. When machine learning is automated, it becomes more user-friendly and frequently produces better, more accurate results than manually-coded algorithms.

Integrating AutoML into the malware
detection pipeline to remove the need to hand design and tune ML models. And, requires much less feature engineering than traditional machine learning approaches. It can model complex functions with image shaped data as input with little to no feature engineering, only requiring the data to be placed in a 2 dimensional input
